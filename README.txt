C++ OOP - Course Project
Remake of a "Fireboy & Watergirl" style game

The game we implemented is based on the game Fireboy & Watergirl.
The dog (the orange character) is controlled by the keyboard arrows, the cat (the gray character) is controlled by A- left, W-up D-right.
The game has 4 level.
The goal is for the two players, the dog, and the cat, to come home together in cooperation.
The level ends when they arrive, but in order to gain more victory points, they must collect all the snacks along the way and arrive at the allocated time to the house
(clarification: you do not have to take all the snacks and arrive home in time to complete the level).
The dog can collect bones, the cat can collect fish, and both can collect the common snacks (bone and fish together).
The number of attempts at each level is not limited, the achievements can only be improved at the level, an achievement that has already been achieved will not be deleted.
Beware of obstacles on the way - floors in special colors. A dog cannot step on a gray floor, a cat cannot step on an orange floor and both cannot step on a blue floor (dog and cat do not like to shower).
If the player hits his head at the bottom of the obstacle he will not be disqualified. When disqualified the level will start again.
Along the way, you have to use the various objects on the game board. Button and switch opening gates and rotating mirrors in 90 degrees.
A button will only work when an object touches it while a switch will work when one of the players turns it on (does not have to stay on it).
You can know who controls whom by the colors of the objects.
The boxes can be moved and used to reach the destination.
In addition, there are mirror boxes and mirrors that rotate in 90 degrees that change the direction of the laser ray and direct it from the source point to the destination point.
When the laser reaches the destination a gate in its color will open.
Restrictions: The size of the board is fixed at 18x18. The board will be framed with floors.
A set of one laser, source, and destination per level.
Each controlling object has only one controlled object and vice versa and they are in the same color ×›or user convenience.
You cannot play a level if you have not finished the previous level (except the first level).

Level file:
Each level will be received from a separate fixed name format file- numberlevel. For example, the name of the first level file is "1", etc.
These files should be of txt type.
The first line in the file is the time the players must complete the level in order to get the time achievement at the end of the level.
Then the floors will appear ('-'), an 18x18 floor frame must be written.
After the floors, we will write line by line the different objects as follows:
The char of an object, row and col (if the object has a certain type, it will be written at the end of the line according to the appropriate marking).
An object that is controlled by another object will be written a line before the controlling object.
You can see all the markups in the Macros.h file.

Main data structures:
Unique_ptr vectors hold the board objects according to the object type.
Unique_ptr pointers that hold both players.
const std::unordered_map <type, sf::Vector2i>.
std :: unordered_map <type, std :: array <float, 4 >> .

Notable algorithms:
3 design patterns:
Factory (templatic) - a factory for producing objects, creates the objects.
Command - a design template that produces menus. We implemented the main menu that provides the actions play, help, exit. Level creates a submenu that has the levels of the game.
From the game itself, you can pause and get to another submenu where there are the options, return to the level screen, restart, and resume.
Multimethod - CollisionHandler class which handles collisions between objects.

Known bugs:
When the player jumps close to the wall, if we press to move right or left it will stay in the air and try to walk.
There is a problem enlarging the screen to full size when the menu is displayed on the screen.

Other notes:
We have extensively used the Box2D physical library. The movement of objects in the game is physically calculated by the library, and the lasers are implemented with the library's ray-casting.
Any exception in the program will be written in the "log.txt" file located in the program folder and the program will end its execution.
